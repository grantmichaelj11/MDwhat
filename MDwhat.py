# How do we want to read input files?
    # GMX style? PDB? XYZ? If traiend from DFT, we probably don't need bonded information?
# How to handle solvent interactions?
    # Implicit/Explicit?    
# Temperature dependencies?

# Initialize Simulation box (read xyz file)
# Calculate Pressure
# Calculate Enthalpy
# Calculate Temperature
# Declare integrater (velocity verlet)
# Declare DFT functional

# Need to read about ab-initio MD
# DFT calculations and force extraction
# Other electronic properties from DFT?
